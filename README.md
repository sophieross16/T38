 ## 1 - Project Descriptions
 ### Compulsory Task 1
 ### Files: 
 #### 1. 'semantic.py'
 This involved firstly testing the semantic similarity of a selection of words, before analysing the results. 
 #### 2. 'example.py'
 This involved testing the differences between using en_core_web_sm and en_core_web_sm. The results are printed when the program is run and show that different model sizes produce different results
 
 ### Compulsory Task 2
 #### Files:
1. movies.txt

This file is used to read in movies and descriptions for the watch_next.py program

2. watch_next.py
 
 This project involved taking a text file of movies and their descriptions, and using this to return a similar movie description to that inputted by the user
 
## 2 - Installation: 
 To install the project locally, perform the following steps:
  1 - Download the files and ensure they are saved in the same folder
  2 - Use a Python compiler of your choice (this program was built using Spyder) 
  3 - Open the .py files (semantic.py, example.py, watch_next.py) and run the program
 
## 3 - Usage
#### example.py
 1. Run the program
 2. The similarity values are outputted
 3. Comments on the differences between en_core_web_sm and en_core_web_md are outputted at the bottom of the console
 
#### semantic.py
  1. Run the program
  2. The comments are outputted at the bottom of the console
  
#### watch_next.py
  1. Run the program
  2. The user is requested to input a movie description
  3. Enter the description and press enter
  4. The movie name is outputted, along with the similarity value and the description
